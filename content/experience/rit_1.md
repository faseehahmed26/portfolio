### Description

- Designed hands-on projects for the Intro to Machine Learning course, translating theoretical concepts into practical Python and PyTorch implementations that reinforced student understanding.
- Provided personalized technical support and mentorship to over 25 graduate students, significantly improving their grasp of complex distributed machine learning concepts and implementation techniques.
- Created comprehensive tutorial materials on distributed computing paradigms, helping students navigate challenging topics including parameter server architectures and decentralized training.
- Led weekly lab sessions focusing on practical machine learning implementations, guiding students through model development, training optimization, and performance evaluation.
- Developed and graded assessment materials that effectively evaluated student understanding of core machine learning concepts and their ability to implement solutions independently.
- Facilitated student research projects, helping them formulate hypotheses, design experiments, and analyze results using appropriate statistical methods and visualization techniques.
- Collaborated with faculty to refine course curriculum, incorporating the latest advances in machine learning and distributed computing to keep content relevant and cutting-edge.
- Organized and moderated peer learning sessions where students could collaborate on complex problems, fostering a supportive learning environment that improved overall class performance.
- Implemented a structured feedback system that identified common learning obstacles, allowing for targeted intervention that reduced assignment resubmission rates by 30%.
