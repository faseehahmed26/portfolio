### Description

- Developed a conversation-based Data Quality Tool (DQT) using RAG architecture and Mistral 7B, enabling data analysts to query clinical trial data in natural language with 90% accuracy and reducing analysis time by 45%.
- Built a modular GenAI system with three configurable RAG pipelines, optimizing for different use cases: fast prototyping, balanced production use, and high-precision regulatory reporting.
- Engineered an intelligent document processing system using BERT-based models for ICF classification, implementing weak supervision techniques that reduced manual labeling by 70% while maintaining high data quality.
- Designed data pipelines integrating clinical trial data from Veeva Vault to Redshift data warehouse, creating optimized data models that improved query performance for Tableau dashboard builders by 40%.
- Fine-tuned specialized LLMs for clinical trial domain knowledge using LoRA, increasing classification F1-scores from 0.58 to 0.84 and reducing hallucinations by 65% in RAG responses.
- Created a comprehensive evaluation framework benchmarking different embedding models (all-MiniLM-L6-v2, all-mpnet-base-v2, intfloat/e5-large) with corresponding vector stores (FAISS, HNSW, Chroma), enabling data teams to select optimal configurations for their specific use cases.
- Developed an ETL workflow automation using Airflow and SQLAlchemy that ensured data integrity between source systems and analytical platforms, reducing manual intervention by 80%.
- Collaborated with Tableau developers to implement a hybrid analytics approach combining traditional dashboards with conversational AI interfaces, allowing non-technical stakeholders to access insights directly.
- Applied advanced NLP techniques including semantic search, text clustering with BERTopic, and chunk optimization strategies that improved information retrieval precision by 35% for clinical trial documentation.
- Built an end-to-end LLM deployment pipeline with model quantization (GGUF) and serving optimization (vLLM), reducing inference latency by 62% while maintaining response quality for production environments.
