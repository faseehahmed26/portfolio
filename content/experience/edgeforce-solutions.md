### Description

- Engineered a YOLOv5-based real-time object detection system for inventory management, creating a complete ML pipeline from data collection and annotation to deployment, achieving 90% accuracy in automated tracking and reducing manual counting time by 60%.
- Built a responsive web interface using Streamlit and integrated WebRTC for low-latency video processing, enabling real-time object recognition with less than 200ms latency while maintaining detection precision across varied lighting conditions.
- Developed an end-to-end data pipeline for ML model training, implementing custom data augmentation techniques that improved model generalization by 40% for inconsistent lighting and reflective surfaces common in storage environments.
- Created a portable radio simulator for military training using Python, WebRTC and socket programming, implementing real-time audio transmission with AES-256 encryption that reduced hardware dependency by 80% while maintaining secure communications.
- Designed and optimized a custom audio packet prioritization system that reduced transmission latency from 1.5 seconds to under 200ms, implementing Forward Error Correction algorithms that recovered up to 90% of lost packets in challenging network conditions.
- Implemented comprehensive database integration using SQLite with custom API endpoints, enabling automated inventory updates and alerts for low stock conditions that reduced stockouts and overstocking issues by 70%.
- Developed a cross-platform deployment architecture using Docker and AWS services (EC2, Lambda, S3), ensuring scalability while maintaining consistent performance across different operating environments.
- Engineered an advanced speech recognition system with PyTorch, achieving 95% accuracy when deployed in an army communication emulator, significantly enhancing training realism and combat readiness.
- Created detailed Software Requirement Specifications that effectively managed evolving client requirements, reducing scope creep and ensuring project stability while delivering on core objectives within tight timelines.
- Built a custom dataset creation and annotation pipeline using Roboflow, developing efficient labeling workflows that accelerated data preparation and enabled rapid model iterations to meet changing recognition requirements.
