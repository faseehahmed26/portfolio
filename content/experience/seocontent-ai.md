### Description

- Architected an end-to-end data pipeline for AI-driven content generation, leveraging microservices to process, transform, and deliver SEO-optimized content at scale with 60x reduction in operational costs.
- Engineered a containerized NLP infrastructure using AWS ECS, Lambda, and API Gateway to dynamically select and deploy the optimal language model (GPT-3.5, BERT, FLAN-T5) based on content requirements and cost constraints.
- Designed a modular prompt engineering system with version control that enabled non-technical users to modify AI behavior without developer intervention, reducing engineering overhead by 40%.
- Built a Chrome extension using Python, JavaScript, and NodeJS that increased content generation speed by 40% while maintaining quality through automated SEO validation checks.
- Implemented robust data transformation workflows across the entire content lifecycle, from raw keyword extraction to structured, SEO-optimized output, ensuring consistent data quality at every stage.
- Developed automated keyword clustering algorithms using advanced NLP techniques, enabling the platform to generate topically-related article sets that improved organic search traffic by 30-35%.
- Constructed intelligent data processing pipelines that seamlessly integrated with third-party platforms (Shopify, WooCommerce, WordPress) via custom APIs, allowing direct content publishing without manual intervention.
- Created scalable ETL processes to ingest, transform, and analyze SEO performance data from multiple sources (Google Search Console, Ahrefs, SEMrush), forming a feedback loop that continuously improved content quality.
- Optimized infrastructure costs through strategic use of containerization, caching mechanisms, and serverless architectures, achieving a 35% reduction in cloud expenditure while handling increased processing volumes.
- Implemented comprehensive monitoring and alerting systems using CloudWatch and SNS, ensuring 99.9% API availability and rapid response to performance anomalies.
