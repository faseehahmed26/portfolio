### Description

- Pioneered advanced federated learning architectures by transitioning from request-based to gRPC communication protocols, significantly enhancing cross-device model synchronization and security.
- Led implementation of the FedDisco algorithm within distributed learning frameworks, reducing model convergence time by 20% and enabling adaptive communication strategies for real-time updates.
- Engineered specialized distributed training techniques for Large Language Models (LLMs), achieving a 30% performance boost while minimizing network latency and resource consumption.
- Optimized PyTorch RPC-based distributed environments, reducing communication overhead by 15% through advanced data transfer protocol refinements and node orchestration.
- Developed a production-ready React Native application enabling on-device federated learning with TensorFlow.js, making sophisticated AI training accessible on resource-constrained mobile devices.
- Designed and implemented custom secure communication channels using gRPC for sensitive data synchronization, improving overall model accuracy by 10% while maintaining strict privacy constraints.
- Collaborated directly with Prof. Haibo Yang to enhance the theoretical foundations and practical implementations of federated learning frameworks for edge computing applications.
- Created and optimized custom loss functions and training regimes tailored for inconsistent network conditions, improving model robustness in real-world distributed environments.
- Mentored graduate students in advanced distributed systems concepts, providing technical guidance that significantly improved their implementation quality and research outcomes.
