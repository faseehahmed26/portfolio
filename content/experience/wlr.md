### Description

- Architected an end-to-end NLP pipeline that automated article generation for digital marketing, achieving a 60x reduction in operational costs through strategic implementation of AWS Lambda, NodeJS, and API Gateway.
- Engineered a scalable content generation system processing over 130,000 high-quality articles weekly, implementing distributed processing across multiple language models to balance computational load.
- Developed sophisticated model selection and orchestration layers to dynamically route content generation requests to the optimal LLM (BERT, RoBERTa, ALBERT, or DistilBERT) based on content complexity, topic, and quality requirements.
- Implemented advanced fine-tuning pipelines for multiple language models, achieving 42% improvement in contextual understanding and content relevance through targeted domain adaptation.
- Designed a comprehensive data lifecycle management system using DynamoDB, ensuring efficient data access patterns and optimized read/write operations for high-throughput content generation.
- Created modular prompt engineering frameworks that enabled non-technical users to customize content generation without engineering intervention, improving cross-team collaboration and reducing development bottlenecks.
- Built real-time content validation and quality assurance pipelines that performed automated checks for SEO compliance, readability, and brand tone adherence before delivery.
- Established an event-driven ETL architecture for keyword extraction and content clustering, enabling automatic identification of topic hierarchies and semantic relationships between generated articles.
- Implemented intelligent data transformation workflows that converted unstructured source materials into structured, SEO-optimized content through multi-stage NLP processing.
- Integrated comprehensive monitoring and analytics using CloudWatch and custom logging frameworks, providing real-time insights into model performance, content quality metrics, and system health.
