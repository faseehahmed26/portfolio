### Description

- Engineered a sophisticated image classification system using Faster R-CNN for cancer cell detection in histopathological images, achieving 0.82 F1 score across 1,000 validated samples while optimizing model architecture for clinical efficiency.
- Developed a custom segmentation pipeline with Detectron2 that precisely delineated tumor boundaries in high-resolution medical scans, implementing a specialized loss function that improved detection accuracy by 20% on challenging cases.
- Built an end-to-end automated annotation workflow integrating QuPath with custom Groovy scripts, reducing manual processing time by 60% and enabling seamless data transfer from pathologists' annotations to AI training systems.
- Implemented YOLOv5 for real-time pathological slide screening, optimizing performance through custom data augmentation pipelines that expanded training datasets from 800 to 2,400 images while preserving critical pathological features.
- Created a distributed training framework using Horovod that accelerated model training by 3.9x, reducing cycle time from 3 weeks to 5 days while processing 1.5TB of medical imaging data weekly.
- Architected a multi-model AI system that combined outputs from tubule, mitosis, and nuclear pleomorphism detection models to automate Nottingham Grading for breast carcinoma, improving diagnostic accuracy from 80% to 92%.
- Engineered sliding window inference and efficient CUDA memory management techniques for whole-slide images (40,000Ã—40,000 pixels), reducing GPU memory usage by 40% while maintaining inference speed.
- Developed comprehensive MLOps practices including Docker containerization, model versioning with DVC, experiment tracking via MLflow, and automated testing with pytest, ensuring reproducible and scalable AI deployment.
- Built an ensemble approach combining Faster R-CNN and YOLOv5 outputs, implementing gradCAM visualization to provide interpretable heatmaps of model decisions that increased pathologist trust in AI-assisted diagnosis.
- Published two research papers at prestigious medical imaging conferences, establishing novel methodologies for tubule detection and mitosis identification using deep learning approaches for breast cancer diagnosis.
