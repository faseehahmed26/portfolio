## Description

I built a real-time beverage inventory management system that combines computer vision with a database backend to automate stock tracking. The application uses YOLOv5 object detection to identify different beverage types (Coca-Cola, Sprite, Pepsi, etc.) through a camera feed, automatically updating inventory counts in a SQLite database.

The system features dual access modes - a staff interface for real-time scanning and an admin dashboard for inventory management. I implemented WebRTC for smooth live video streaming with detection speeds as low as 5ms per frame, ensuring the system could operate efficiently even on mobile devices. 

Key technical achievements include:
- Custom-trained YOLOv5 model optimized for beverage recognition with 90% accuracy
- Responsive Streamlit frontend with real-time video processing
- Automated database updates tracking inventory changes by date and product
- Support for both live camera detection and image upload workflows

This project demonstrates practical application of deep learning in retail inventory management, significantly reducing manual counting time and improving accuracy. I also published an article about this project on Medium, explaining the implementation details and development process.
