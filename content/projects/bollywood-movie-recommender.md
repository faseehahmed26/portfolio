### Description

* Engineered a comprehensive data pipeline to scrape, process, and analyze 3,100+ Bollywood movies from IMDB using Python, BeautifulSoup, and Requests.

* Implemented robust web scraping algorithms to extract detailed movie information including cast, plot summaries, keywords, release dates, genres, and user reviews from multiple IMDB pages.

* Built data cleaning and transformation workflows that structured unformatted HTML content into a clean, analysis-ready dataset with 11 normalized features.

* Developed automated data enrichment processes to calculate derived metrics including content age, plot keyword extraction, and temporal analysis of movie releases.

* Created error handling mechanisms to manage inconsistent HTML structures, missing data points, and rate limiting during the scraping process.

* Optimized the scraping workflow by implementing randomized delays and batch processing, successfully extracting data from 4,000 movie search queries.

* Constructed a scalable ETL pipeline that transformed raw HTML into structured data stored in CSV format for downstream recommendation algorithms.

* Integrated metadata analysis techniques to identify patterns in movie genres, plot elements, and cast relationships across Bollywood cinema.

* Designed the foundation for a recommendation system utilizing content-based filtering based on movie metadata and similarity metrics.
