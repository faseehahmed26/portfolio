## Description

**Banking Investment Portfolio Dynamics** is a comprehensive data visualization and analysis project examining how regulatory changes influenced investment strategies across banking institutions between 2009-2018. This study reveals critical insights into how financial institutions adapted their portfolio compositions in response to post-financial crisis regulatory reforms, with particular focus on the dramatic divergence between large and small banks.

##### 🔍 Core Technology

The analysis leverages advanced statistical and data visualization techniques to identify patterns in banking investment behavior:

- 📊 **Time Series Analysis**: Tracking HTM (Held-to-Maturity) and AFS (Available-for-Sale) investment trends over a decade
- 📈 **Comparative Metrics**: Quantifying the 4-fold increase in large banks' HTM percentages versus stable ratios in smaller institutions
- 📉 **Volatility Measurement**: Assessing capital ratio fluctuations through standard deviation and trend analysis
- 🔄 **Regulatory Impact Modeling**: Correlating portfolio shifts with implementation of AOCI (Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income) inclusion requirements

##### ⚙️ Key Visualizations

1. **Investment Growth Trends** (image-1): Comparing HTM and AFS investment growth patterns across all banks, large banks, and small banks.
2. **Portfolio Composition Shift** (image-2): Analyzing changes in HTM percentage over time with dramatic divergence after 2013 regulatory changes.
3. **Individual Bank Analysis** (image-3): Quantifying HTM percentage changes for 15 major financial institutions from 2013-2018.
4. **Case Studies of Major Banks** (image-4): Detailed examination of investment strategies for banks with the most significant portfolio shifts.
5. **Capital Ratio Volatility** (image-5): Measuring T1R and TCR capital ratio stability between large and small banks over time.

##### 💬 Key Findings

> "Large banks increased their HTM percentage from 6% (2009) to 28% (2018) - a 4-fold increase - while small banks maintained consistent HTM allocation around 14%, demonstrating a direct response to regulatory changes requiring large banks to include AOCI in capital calculations."

##### 🌱 Project Impact

- Revealed clear evidence of regulatory adaptation strategies among financial institutions
- Quantified how capital requirement changes influenced investment decision-making
- Identified significant portfolio restructuring among large banks to minimize regulatory capital volatility
- Demonstrated smaller institutions' relative insulation from certain regulatory pressures
- Provided data-driven insights into banking sector response to post-2008 financial reforms

##### 🎯 Applications & Significance

This analysis offers valuable insights for financial regulators, banking executives, and market analysts seeking to understand how regulatory frameworks influence institutional behavior and investment patterns. The findings highlight the sometimes unexpected consequences of regulatory changes and demonstrate how data visualization can reveal complex adaptation strategies within the financial sector.
