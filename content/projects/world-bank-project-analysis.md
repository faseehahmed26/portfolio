### Description

* Developed a high-performance predictive model achieving 71.7% F1 score to identify factors influencing World Bank project success or closure, enabling better resource allocation decisions and risk assessment.

* Engineered a robust feature selection pipeline to handle complex hierarchical data with 17,500+ records and 27 variables, reducing dimensionality while preserving critical predictive signals.

* Implemented XGBoost classification with hyperparameter optimization via RandomizedSearchCV, systematically evaluating model performance across multiple parameter combinations.

* Created data preprocessing workflows to address significant missing data (30%+ in key fields) and class imbalance (90/10 split), ensuring model generalizability and statistical validity.

* Conducted in-depth exploratory data analysis uncovering relationships between regional, financial, and categorical variables that influence project outcomes across 200+ countries.

* Designed custom evaluation metrics prioritizing F1 score over accuracy to account for class imbalance, providing stakeholders with realistic performance expectations.

* Optimized model parameters including learning rate, tree depth, and regularization techniques to prevent overfitting while maximizing predictive performance.

* Implemented an automated model persistence system with pickle, enabling seamless deployment for future predictions and analysis.

* Delivered comprehensive statistical analysis of model performance including precision (80.6%), recall (64.6%), and mean absolute error metrics for stakeholder interpretation.
