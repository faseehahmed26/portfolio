## Description

I developed an intelligent COVID-19 chatbot deployed on Telegram that provides users with critical pandemic-related information and assistance. This AI-powered solution addresses the need for accessible, accurate, and timely COVID-19 information during a global health crisis.

The chatbot leverages Google DialogFlow's natural language processing capabilities to understand user queries and provide appropriate responses across multiple categories:

- Real-time COVID-19 statistics by region using RapidAPI integration
- Vaccination appointment scheduling based on user preferences
- Critical resource location (oxygen supplies, plasma donations)
- Latest government announcements and health guidelines
- Frequently asked questions about COVID-19
- News updates and preventive measures

From a technical perspective, the project features a sophisticated architecture with DialogFlow handling natural language understanding, Flask powering the backend logic, MongoDB storing user data and preferences, and seamless integration with Telegram's Bot API for message delivery.

A key advantage of this implementation is its multilingual support, making critical health information accessible to non-English speakersâ€”particularly important in diverse regions where English is not the primary language. The system was designed with scalability in mind, allowing for easy expansion of features and language support as pandemic information evolved.

This project demonstrates practical application of natural language processing and API integration to create a useful tool during a public health emergency, providing timely information and assistance when traditional information channels were overwhelmed.
