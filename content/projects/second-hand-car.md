## Description

I developed a machine learning application that accurately predicts used car prices based on various parameters, addressing the growing market demand for reliable pricing tools in the second-hand vehicle market. This end-to-end project combines data science and web development to create an accessible user interface for price estimation.

The development process followed a comprehensive workflow:

1. **Data Cleaning** - Processed the CarDekho dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing formats to ensure data quality.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis** - Uncovered key relationships between vehicle features and pricing using visualization tools (Seaborn, Matplotlib) to identify the most influential factors.

3. **Feature Engineering** - Created new attributes and transformed existing ones to improve model performance, including categorical encoding and feature scaling.

4. **Model Training** - Implemented and compared multiple regression algorithms (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost), ultimately selecting Random Forest Regression for its superior prediction accuracy.

5. **Web Application Development** - Built an intuitive user interface using Flask, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, allowing users to input vehicle specifications and receive instant price estimates.

This project demonstrates practical application of machine learning in the automotive industry, helping both buyers and sellers make informed decisions about used car valuations with a user-friendly web interface.
