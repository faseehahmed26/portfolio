## Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for predicting customer churn in the telecommunications industry. It seamlessly integrates data ingestion, preprocessing, model evaluation, and deployment, showcasing my expertise in building production-grade solutions.

## Key Skills Demonstrated

- **Data Engineering & Ingestion:**  
  Designed robust data pipelines using validated schemas and YAML configuration for data ingestion and validation.

- **Machine Learning & Model Evaluation:**  
  Implemented comprehensive model evaluation techniques using MLflow to track experiments, parameters, and metrics.

- **Deployment & CI/CD:**  
  Automated the build, containerization, and deployment process using Docker and GitHub Actions, with deployment on AWS (EC2, ECR).

- **Cloud & DevOps Integration:**  
  Configured AWS services and implemented continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to ensure scalable and reliable project delivery.

- **End-to-End Workflow Management:**  
  Combined data ingestion, model evaluation, and deployment into a cohesive framework, ensuring reproducibility and traceability across the entire ML lifecycle.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Languages & Frameworks:** Python, Flask, Docker  
- **ML & Data Tools:** MLflow, Pandas, YAML, Statsmodels  
- **Cloud & Deployment:** AWS (EC2, ECR), GitHub Actions, CI/CD pipelines  
- **Version Control:** Git and GitHub

This project exemplifies my ability to tackle complex data science challenges and deliver scalable, production-ready solutions. Whether it's fine-tuning models, tracking experiments, or automating deployments, I bring a full spectrum of technical expertise to every project.
