      <description>Project overview In this project I learned about the time series analysis using Deep Learning and also learned how to built a scraper which can scrape data, based on respective timeline provided and can give output in csv or an excel file. improved my visualization skills using seaborn and matplotlib.
Analytical Insights From Last 5 Years
● Crude Oil prices is strongly correlated with Brent Oil and Natural Gas
● Crude Oil prices is positively correlated with Copper.</description>

      <description>Project overview This Web App aids in mobile inventory management. The frontend of the mobile device shows a stream of things being displayed; a deep learning model uses this data to identify the objects and automatically updates the Inventory Database frontend display with the changes.
● Using state of the art Yolov5 model with detection speed as low as 5ms per frame.
● Built the frontend using Streamlit.
● Using SQLite3 as a Database for managing inventory.</description>

      <description>Project overview Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global health problem with high morbidity and mortality rate, and it induces other diseases. Since there are no obvious values during the early stages of CKD, patients often fail to notice the disease. Early detection of CKD enables patients to receive timely treatment to ameliorate the progression of this disease. Machine learning models can effectively aid clinicians achieve this goal due to their fast and accurate recognition performance.</description>

      <description>Project overview Chatbot is a computer program designed to simulate conversation with human users, especially over the internet. Simple chatbots work based on pre-written keywords that they understand, each of these commands must be written by the developer separately using regular expressions or other form of string analysis, if the user has asked a question without using a single keyword the bot cannot understand it and as a rule responds with default messages.</description>

      <description>Project overview
Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning is found to be really helpful in predicting prices of used vehicles, with increase in demand for used cars more and vehicle buyers are finding alternatives of buying new cars. There is a need of accurate price prediction mechanism for the used cars. Prediction techniques of machine learning can be helpful in this regard.
